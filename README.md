-_**SP_TO_JS**_-
What the actual fuck is this you ask, well, we all know the beloved scratch.mit.edu, if your a coder such as me, you either started with HTML or scratch (more preferably scratch)
this is mainly for linux, but you can upload a .sb3 file and, it converts the file name from .sb3 to .zip, and it then extracts the contents, and searches for "project.json"
and it then converts that JSON into JS, for idk what. but hey you guys figure it out.
