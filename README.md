-_**SP_TO_JS**_-
What the actual fuck is this you ask, well, we all know the beloved scratch.mit.edu, if your a coder such as me, you either started with HTML or scratch (more preferably scratch)
this is mainly for linux, but you can upload a .sb3 file and, it converts the file name from .sb3 to .zip, and it then extracts the contents, and searches for "project.json"
and it then converts that JSON into JS, for idk what. but hey you guys figure it out.


|**Tutorials**|

Linux:
1.Download the latest version from the releases.
2.Once that is done you should have a file named Sp-To-JS.py
3. Go into your terminal and type ```sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3```
4.Once you have your dependencies complete do ```python3 Sp-To-JS.py```


Once that is done you can now type in the location of the .sb3 project, And Viola!


Mobile:
Not supported but maybe in the future


Windows: 
Lol again maybe in the future, oh wait what the fuck am I talking about! just download VScode and follow the steps in Linux.
